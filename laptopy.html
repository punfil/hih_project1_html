        The 200 series was developed as a very compact subnotebook line, in comparison to the 500 series.
        While some of the 500 series' models included a docking connector for additional expand-ability, the 200 series did not have such a connector present on any of its models. This was to further reduce the physical dimensions and weight in all areas.
        Following the discontinuation of every numerical series ThinkPads, the 200 series was replaced with the S series as its successor.

        The 300 series was developed as a budget notebook machine line, in order to give an alternative to those who could not afford the high cost associated with the 700 series.
        Due to budget being the main focus of this series, most of the cutting-edge features have been either reduced, or removed completely to compensate for the cheaper cost. The build quality was also affected, in a way that made most of the models' designs to be slightly bigger than necessary.
        Following the discontinuation of every numerical series ThinkPads, the 300 series was replaced with the R series as its successor.

        The 500 series was developed as a compact subnotebook machine line. This was to fill in the gap of a very portable, but still reasonably powerful laptop.
        As the models were made as thin and light as it could be, it had to naturally exclude the floppy drive and the optical drive from its design. That shortfall was easily fixed however, as the late introduction of a docking port gave it the ability to use optical drives or floppy drives. Although, it came with the disadvantage of being thicker and heavier.
        Following the discontinuation of every numerical series ThinkPads, the 500 series was replaced with the X series as its successor.

        The 600 series was developed as a slim notebook machine line, with the intention of being slightly heavier than a 500 series to include the features of a 700 series equivalent.
        This was to create a bridge between the subnotebook and the notebook form factor, in such a way that it has reasonable weight and reasonable performance to cater to those that did not need all-out portability or performance. In other words, it focuses on merging two design goals to create a middle-ground, rather than focusing on one design goal to the extreme.
        Following the discontinuation of every numerical series ThinkPads, the 600 series was replaced with the T series as its successor.

        The 700 series was developed as a high-end notebook machine line, generally featuring cutting-edge technology.
        Strangely, the 700 series had apparently two purposes to fulfill. One was to be a mainstream notebook range, which offered the fastest hardware that technology could allow, while the secondary purpose was to offer experimental models with unconventional features. Those were generally the tablets or the 2-in-1 convertibles, which stood out from the rest of the normal notebook models.
        Following the discontinuation of every numerical series ThinkPads, the 700 series was replaced with the A series as its successor.

    <div class="seria_laptop">
        The 800 series was developed as mobile PowerPC Reference Platform (PReP) machine line, which was meant to be a direct successor of the older RISC System/6000 Model 7007-N40 notebook. While they resembled RISC System/6000 machines, they are actually not RISC System/6000 machines, and are Power Personal Systems. This had an advantage of allowing them to boot other PowerPC-based operating systems with the help of Dakota (Power Personal System Firmware codename), and not just AIX.
        As every model featured in the 800 series were PReP-compliant machines, they were capable of running PowerPC-only operating systems and its related applications. The operating systems were: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, IBM OS/2 Warp (PowerPC Edition), IBM AIX 4.1.x and 4.2.x, Sun Solaris 2.5.1, and Linux (PowerPC-based kernels). Unfortunately, they were not able to run Apple System 7 or Mac OS 8, as they were not Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) compliant.
        This series did not last long, however, as the amount of programs which were made for the PowerPC architecture was very low. Furthermore, the pricing range for most of the models were very outrageously expensive, going as high as $18,000 (inflation not factored in). With resulting poor sales, the 800 series was discontinued and was never to be brought back with a successor.

        The T series was developed as a direct successor of the discontinued 600 series, with a little more emphasis on slimness.
        A very notable addition to the T series, was the late inclusion of a 'mobile workstation' configuration. This was not present in the original 600 series, due to the lack of graphics controllers that were certified for CAD applications.

        TThe R series was developed as a direct successor of the discontinued 300 series. Other than lacking 2-in-1 convertible models, it served the same purpose as the 300 series did.
        From the R50 onward, the R series turned into what was basically a duplicate of the T series that was thicker, and with less features. It also had a less luxurious construction, as its lid was not rubberized like the T series' lid was. Another major difference was that it had FireWire, which was something that the T series did not have until the introduction of the T61.
        Eventually, the R series was discontinued and was indirectly succeeded by the SL series. However, Lenovo has bought it back to serve as a more luxurious sidegrade for the E series. The new R series now features an identical construction to its E series counterparts, and has aluminium lids to identify itself as the luxury counterpart of the E series.

        The A series was developed as a direct successor of the discontinued 700 series, but after Lenovo's re-introduction in 2018, it was considered a small branch-off of the T and X series with AMD hardware.
        The early IBM models were mobile workstations, designed to cool and contain powerful graphics controllers for its era. They were also notable for being 3-spindle machines (with one Ultrabay), although the A3x models took an extra step above that and had two Ultrabays instead.
        Unfortunately, the focus for more mobile workstations had taken over, and so the A series was discontinued in favor of the lighter T series 'p' models.

        The Z series was developed as a widescreen-only multimedia machine line with an aspect ratio of 16:10 (5:3 for the Z60t), in contrast to the ThinkPads of the time, which were usually produced with a standard aspect ratio of 4:3. In addition, they were also produced with a multi-card/SD card reader. This was to fulfill the needs of a multimedia user in general, who would often take photos and transfer them via a multimedia card.
        They were also somewhat unique for their inclusion of a lid made out of titanium; similar to the Titanium PowerBook G4. Although, this was only offered as an option, and could still be equipped with a normal plastic lid.
        The Z series was eventually discontinued, as the release of a widescreen T60 model made the selling point of the Z series redundant.

        Strangely, some of the models were duplicates of the A series, X series, 200 series, and the 500 series, but often with much less features and lower performance. Some of the other models that were not merely duplicates of a certain series, had interesting features, such as being able to play music CDs while not being powered-on. Although, that came with a trade-off; no dock connectors.

Apart from that, two models of the X series were built with an internal optical drive. This was an odd departure from the usual norm of every X series model, which never included an internal optical drive.
